## AL Comsci (CIE 9618)

Personal workspace for Cambridge International AS & A Level Computer Science (CIE 9618). This folder will hold notes, code, practice, and resources aligned to the 9618 syllabus and exam style.

### What will be here
- **theory/**: Topic notes and quick references (e.g., data representation, hardware, networks, OS, security, ethics).
- **programming/**: Python solutions, utilities, and practice tasks.
- **data-structures/**: Implementations such as stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, hash tables.
- **algorithms/**: Searching, sorting, recursion, graph algorithms, dynamic programming practice.
- **pseudocode/**: CIE-style pseudocode solutions and templates.
- **pre-release/**: Work for pre-release material (scenario analysis, data prep, solutions).
- **past-papers/**: Attempted papers and working; may include split topical practice.
- **mark-schemes/**: Extracted marking points and notes from MS for revision.
- **notes/**: Cheatsheets, concept summaries, and exam tips.
- **resources/**: Useful links, PDFs, and references.

### Syllabus and assessment (CIE 9618)
- **Paper 1 (AS)**: Theory fundamentals
- **Paper 2 (AS)**: Programming and problem-solving (includes pseudocode)
- **Paper 3 (A Level)**: Advanced theory
- **Paper 4 (A Level)**: Further problem-solving and programming

Use official syllabus/specimen materials for exact detail and updates.

### Pseudocode conventions
Follow CIE 9618 pseudocode conventions and structures consistently (naming, control flow blocks, standard functions). Keep code and pseudocode consistent so translation between them is easy.

### Running code
- Python 3.x is assumed.
- Run any file from this folder, e.g.: `python3 path/to/file.py`

### Naming and organisation
- Prefer descriptive filenames (e.g., `Stack.py`, `LinkedList.py`, `binary_tree.py`).
- Keep each topic or data structure in its own file/folder.
- Add a short header comment to longer files to state purpose and usage.

### Useful references

Keep this README brief and update the structure above as folders are added.
