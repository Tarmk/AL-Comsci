## AL Comsci (CIE 9618)

Personal workspace for Cambridge International AS & A Level Computer Science (CIE 9618). This folder will hold notes, code, practice, and resources aligned to the 9618 syllabus and exam style.

### Folder layout
- **python/data_structures/**: Procedural and OOP Python implementations (stacks, queues, circular queues, etc.).
- **python/misc/**: Other example Python programs (e.g., `car.py`, fish examples).
- **pseudocode/data_structures/**: CIE-style pseudocode for data structures (procedural and OOP variants).
- Further folders can be added later (e.g., `theory/`, `algorithms/`, `pre-release/`).

### Syllabus and assessment (CIE 9618)
- **Paper 1 (AS)**: Theory fundamentals
- **Paper 2 (AS)**: Programming and problem-solving (includes pseudocode)
- **Paper 3 (A Level)**: Advanced theory
- **Paper 4 (A Level)**: Further problem-solving and programming

Use official syllabus/specimen materials for exact detail and updates.

### Pseudocode conventions
Follow CIE 9618 pseudocode conventions and structures consistently (naming, control flow blocks, standard functions). Keep code and pseudocode consistent so translation between them is easy.

### Running code
- Python 3.x is assumed.
- Run any file from this folder, e.g.: `python3 path/to/file.py`

### Naming and organisation
- Prefer descriptive filenames and group by topic under the folders above.
- Keep each structure/version (procedural vs OOP) in its own file.
- Add a short header to longer files to state purpose and usage.

### Useful references

Keep this README brief and update the structure above as folders are added.
